Learnings : 
1. Comments are super useful you need to get over your Compulsive Disorder about comments and spaces , If some function is working good then just hide it using vs code function hiding arrow for screen space 

2. If something that you are writing in readme is super useful then write it in one note also don't procrastinate just write that immediately 

3. Think of some test cases like extreme ones like ones that defy your approach before you write your code 



So this is the journey to learn every DSA problem 


I am thinking of solving every Easy problem and move to medium then hard 


Easy	= 363 total Problems 
Medium  = 661 
Hard	= 279 

Since I am ready to solve all this problems I am thinking like why not create a program to create folders and files in each folder so that I don't have to copy and paste again let's think it for 5 minutes in every level and see what I can come up with 

I have created the folders now next is I have done couple of easy questions now I am wondering is it even worth of my time to solve all the easy problems like it would be best if I go with medium level problems like even if I solve 2 everyday then 661/2 = 330 days like I will try these for a few days and will write my assumption below after some experience 



I don't know but I am trying to solve some medium level problems cause it is still some headache to see every leet code easy level problem and realise that it is just too easy 


when you look at question number 2462 , You'll realize that the lesson taught at jovian is 100% true about DSA , That you need to cover all edge cases in order to develop a condition and to get a better idea , like read the approach file there 


Questions I need to think : 

1. check 2739 I still don't understand how that best solution guy thought of that best solution
