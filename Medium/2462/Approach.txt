Approach_1 : 

I think the approach is straight forward there is no matter 

sudo code : 

class Solution:
    def totalCost(self, costs: List[int], k: int, candidates: int) -> int:
        first_group , second_group = split the given list 
        # find minimum in both groups and select the one with lowest compared to this two 
        # if they are tie select the first group one I mean remove it 
        # now merge the lists and rotate again 
        # if size is less than candidates then just select the minimum and remove it 
        # all the while loop like this for i in range(k): 

Failed : 

This didn't work cause the pop method and the adding list is to much time complexity so it failed with time complexity thing 



Even after doing all this it is still saying time limit exceeded I don't understand what to do 



I am sorry I didn't solve this I just copied from best solution in internet looks like learning heapq is the only way to solve this efficiently 

I will try to solve this after learning heapq 


I have learned the basics just check that in learnings folder and heaps section 

now let's solve this using heaps on my own 


Approach_2 : 

Even though I did many trails I didn't write that here so anyway let's take this heap as my second approach 

we first take both front and back sides and convert them to heaps then we add this remaining indexes to it , that's it I think 

sudo code : 

import heapq 
class Solution:
    first_half = []
    heapq.heapify
    def totalCost(self, costs, k: int, candidates: int) -> int:


finally after a hard work it is done 

my code time taken = 6 seconds 
Best solution  = 3 seconds 

let's check why :

most of the code is simillar but you took remaining code to solve , in his approach see that candidates*2+k this method is so greatly thought that it will not leave an situation like deleted number will not be added to the list again from cost  

well if don't understand it clearly think until you understand it and don't close it 


you didn't come up with the candidates*2+k formula because you didn't first evaluate some problems on your own
