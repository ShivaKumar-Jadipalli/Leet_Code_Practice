Hello Harkirat Singh Sir 
I am Shivakumar from Telangana 

If you are reading this please know that I really like your Teaching , Infact I got my first job because of you and lost it because of you  

But before that , 

I got your mail from your recent video " Complete Remote Job Primer " Exactly at " 56:01 " timestamp your mails are clearly visible !

Yeah you should definitely remove that cause your popularity is rapidly increasing and most of the people might spam you , So I don't want to be one of them and I don't want you to stop posting live content too , This is just like a Note point 

I don't know which one you'll open so I sent my message to all of them sorry if it really bothers you , It won't repeat again 

I won't spam you or anything , I promise you that if you don't reply to me this will be my last message to you 

So I want your help on this one thing 

I got my first HR interview at an AI company on August 13 2023 , Where I talked a lot about github and how a company should be in it in order to grow , Then he asked me " What is this obsession with github shiva " , I replied that I know a guy from Youtube and told him about how you cracked a 4cr package just through github in the backpack company ,  After a bunch of questions on Data Science and some GSoc 

Next day he offered me 6.5 LPA with a 3 year bond period with performance based increament 

While me being dumb didn't take that offer and requested a higer package like asked him atleast 7.3 LPA , I don't know anything about working in a company cause I was graduated in 2022 and this was my first job offer and I wasn't able to perform good in the next round he put me through after my request and I lost the job 

Yeah truly dumb right , like I am a heavy masturbater and my mind will be in a foggy state after that , like I showed my another side to the HR infact he is the CEO of that company , it's a startup named HITLOOP , He also gave an interview for forbes article 

Anyways so I am done being a Good guy cause everyone was going with fake certificates and entering into IT , while me being a Lord Shiva follower didn't take that path , I believed that I had the skills and will get a job anyway now no one wants to hire a 2 year career gap fresher Data Science grad , So I am thinking of applying and contributing to the companies you mentioned in " complete remote job primer " video and if they reach out to me I will show them some fake experience certificate , 


Please guide me at this one thig harkirat like I don't know what I am doing, is it right or wrong ? 


I just want to get a job so badly 

Again Thank you for your contribution to the students 

Hoping you will guide me 
Shivakumar
