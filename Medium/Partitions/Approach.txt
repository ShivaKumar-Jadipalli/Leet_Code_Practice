Approach_1 : 
As you can see in the image we will have two types of list , It was better than the approach that I thought of 

coding in general language : 

rules : 
1. following numbers shouldn't be greater than the first number it may be equal but not greater 
2. when adding the numbers one of them should be 1 or else end that tree , like 3+1 but not 2+2 or other 

Requirements : 
1. Need to keep track of all nodes created 


let's write using 8 as an example 
first I will directly send [2111111] and set self.answer = 1 by default 
first I will find the index of 1 and it will return the first occurence by default so I will add that and minus 1 at first and call the function like if  s = index(1) = 1 then 

# if index is really one then no need to check if it is greater than the first element or not 
list[s-1:s] = sum(list[s-1:s]) # make sure it is not greater than first element 
call function 
list[s:s+1] = sum(list[s:s+1])
call function
