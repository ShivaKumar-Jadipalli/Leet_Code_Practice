Approach_1 : 

First of all I don't have enough examples to understand this but I will write a code based on what I understood until now 

so I take every two numbers and follow the rules as he said and return the list 

sudo code : 

i = 0 
j = 1 
while j < len(list):
    if 

I don't want to write here man it is all the same , well for sure I know a medium level one won't be this easy 

what is the answer for [2,9,-10,5,4,3,2,1]
assumption_1 = [2,-10,-10,] , but I feel this is the actual answer = [2,-10]

so for this kind of situation we need to keep I value as the value that is appended in the list and we change to j when the situation is false 
example : same question 

first we check 2 and 9 , where i = 0 , j = 1 
since both are same symbol we add 2 to the list 
and change both i and j value 
we check 9 and -10 , where i = 1 , j = 2 
we add -10 to the list , i = 2 , j = 3 

we check -10 and 5  , where i = 2 , j = 3
we won't add to the list unless i value is changed 

we do the same for all number
