start_time = 30042024_150235

Approach_1 :
I wrote in book but I did a huge mistake I didn't take all sample test cases into account while solving this problem , This was a huge mistake like I wasted some time writing code , Remember run all test cases while solving 


completed_time = 30042024_163725

I didn't think this whole actully I know this solution from the start but I just that it is a time waste if we check all words and we just need a formula to pinpoint the exact area
