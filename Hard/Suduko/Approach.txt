This video clearly explains how to solve the game manually 

https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/description/



Start_time : 16062024_163023 

Approach_1 : 

First let's see the techniques to solve manually 

Rules of the game :
1. No number should be repeated in the row or column or block 

Techniques : 
Consider 3 sections like row = [1,2,3] and column=[1,...9] as section_1 and section_2 ==> row = [4,5,6] and column=[same] and so on 

In Section_1 if a number appears in two rows then it should be present in the third row and filtering the columns should be done according to the rules of the game 

Example : 
Imagine number 4 in [0,2] , [1,5] so it should be also present in [2,x]  , rows and columns are zero indexed , "x" is filtered according to rules 

Basic logics : 

1. If there is only one cell available for a particular number then it is the numbers place 
2. If only one number is missing in either row , column or block then fill it by manually counting the missing number 


Note: 
1. I cannot check my program without generating random test cases , So create a test program with two classes one for testing and another for creating 
2. Always check the noted cells again and again so that we could find a way to remove the numbers until only one is remaining 



Generator.py 
Below is the details of how I wrote that program 

I wrote the filled puzzle from the tutorial and wrote program to check it , 

Approach_1 : 

Looks like creating a random big number and seeing if it is a valid suduko puzzle or not seems like computational heavy , Instead I have to find another way 


I don't think we need a class to do the checking instead a basic function is fine , So we need to find a way to access only the first value in the column and access the values in a 3*3 matrix 


first I created random numbers and checked if it was a valid program or not 


Realization : 

why ra shiva why are you making things complex there is already a problem in leet code and we can just solve that instead of doing all this complex things 



Finally somehow solved it on my own but I cannot understand how to submit it in the leet code anyways , let's see how others are solving it using backtracking or something 

Error_1 : 
I tried to solve it based the video explanation but in a different way that 

my approach : 
I will create a dictonary and store all possible numbers in a particular cell and if any cell has only one possible value then obviously it is the answer right so I fill that cell with that value and refill the dictionary values again , again I fill them and keep rotating until all the cells are filled 

so the error is there are some kind of problems where no cell has a single value in the dictionary so the loop just keeps rotating until limit reached , 


I need to think of another approach but before that I would like to see how this woman solved it https://youtu.be/tvP_FZ-D9Ng?si=H-lWr4W9l66WcMEM 


According to the video : 

Approach_1 : 

Fill the cell with numbers and see if this is a valid suduko or not , If not refill again with another combination and check again keep on doing it until you find the right one 

Like this seems fine but there is too much complexity right also without jumping right into action just watch the video until the end and then write your plan
