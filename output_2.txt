 friends can we complaint on odin School and get our money back , Like even 50% i.e 30,000 would be great right , Odin school themselves say that what we taught here isn't enough to get a job , This days every interview question is asking about chat gpt LLM , GAN's and all what we taught in odin school is just Linear regression and decision trees , What do you think ?

 Yes even in python, they taught very few portion EDA is very much important for developing ML models, they haven't provided much assignments . 

Deep learning ANN, CNN, RNN , LSTM , time series, NLP so much is there in data field 

They have just taught alplahbets.

 If we go for a Case, I think they would agree for compensation, But in the signed document they specifically mentioned that i have to attend all classes but I didn't attend them thinking it is a waste of time and watched code basic and krishna naik videos instead

 Leave that thing to me. I am on my way and won't spare them at any cost.

 We will all support bro i need my money back i am in desperate need of money

 If it is a group complaint police will take it seriously

 Sure. We can sign it digitally from our locations

 If you can record a call with the administration person who spoke to us at first and made fake promises for which we paid money

 Friends can anyone join with me to visit their office directly, So that I would rise a concern to them its either Job or money back anything, What he is putting in website is all sales or marketing accountant, Even if it is a data science job he is asking for experience, what kind of fuck is that

 do it right now talk to him like a fresh candidate wanted to join and record it everything we will make a documentation

 at first we do this thing

 and another call record should be recorded that swathi or something she has a mole on her nose i dont know her name

 we need to record her phone call too

 at first she said 6lpa 

later she said we offer 3.6 lpa initially fake promises

 At first to me they said 15 LPA considering past experience

 Nothing will happen guys, please focus on self learning there are many sites on you tube for data science and generative AI . Learn n try to do  various projects for domain knowledge.

And if interested try to join intership opportunities from different sources.there definitely we can learn something for sure but don't focus on less stipends. Rather than putting our money in institutes is better than learning n doing projects n making some money in interships.

 In Hyderabad there are so many organisations offering intership opportunities some are paying stipend n some or not.

 Friends I understand your concern but Note that we are living in a society where who has the money wins, First let's rise a concern to them and see what they do, If we just jump directly to law then all we get is time and energy waste, Like people who has lost lakhs aren't getting their money back from cyber crimes, Do you think they will solve our case first

 Yeah I know that but I atleast need some money back, I am just asking for your support on fighting them

 What about our money? At least we should create awareness among the youngsters not to waste their money on investing in the odin.


 Can anyone come with me to their office ?

 I am fine with any day not just immediately

 Guys I am sharing this chat with odin school through mail so that they will know about our concerns and hope fully they may try resolve those issues can you atleast type " I support " in chat
